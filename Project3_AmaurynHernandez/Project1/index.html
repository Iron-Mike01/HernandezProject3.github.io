<br>
<dd>New Yorkers have been finding more and more ways to protest President Trump, from stripping his name off buildings he once built to holding demonstrations outside his Midtown Manhattan home/office.

The latest effort: an online petition signed by more than 290,000 people seeks to officially rename one block of Fifth Avenue — where, you guessed it, Trump Tower is located — as President Barack H. Obama Avenue...The local community board has a longstanding moratorium against renaming streets.

The councilman who represents the area said he opposed the petition.</dd>
