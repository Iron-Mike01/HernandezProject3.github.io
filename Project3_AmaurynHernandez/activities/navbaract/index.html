<h2 id="AAsylum">Arhkam Asylum</h2>
<p>According to Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the crumbling Victorian mansion at the heart of the original Arkham Asylum was a single-family home, occupied at the beginning of the twentieth century by the Arkham family. Arkham Asylum: Living Hell elaborates on this information, disclosing that the actual structure was built long before the early 1900s as the "Gotham House of Madness and Ill Humors". The grounds were owned by an occult expert named Jason Blood, who carried out exorcisms on the mentally ill. His patients hailed predominantly from Gotham's poor and superstitious townships, where psychiatric disorders were regarded as synonymous with demonic possession. Blood kept his charges starved and confined to suspended cages, even murdering some in an attempt to obliterate their evil spirits. Blood later sealed up the basement to keep the spirits imprisoned. The House of Madness and Ill Humors was closed down, and the land itself sold to the Arkhams.

After the death of Elizabeth Arkham's unnamed husband, she was cared for by their son, Amadeus. Elizabeth was plagued by dementia and perpetually bedridden; at some point Amadeus told others that Elizabeth had slashed her own throat, but in reality he'd done so when she became too much for him to handle on his own, then repressed memories of the murder. Following Elizabeth's apparent suicide in 1920, Amadeus, now an aspiring psychiatrist, inherited the houseâ€”which he dedicated to accommodating those suffering from serious mental illnesses, as had Elizabeth. Of particular interest to Amadeus was his onetime patient Martin "Mad Dog" Hawkins, a serial killer who raped and sexually mutilated his victims. Arkham felt compassion for Hawkins, whom he perceived as being trapped in the penal system with no hope for proper psychiatric treatment. Construction on the new Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane began the following year with the stated goal of providing such an alternative for mentally ill offenders. As the necessary renovations to the Arkham home began in earnest, Amadeus moved his wife Constance and daughter Harriet to neighboring Metropolis, where he temporarily treated Hawkins and his other patients at the state psychiatric hospital. He returned to Gotham on multiple occasions to oversee work on the new asylum, though on one such occasion "Mad Dog" Hawkins escaped. Arkham was consulted during the manhunt by the Metropolis police and prison authorities, but the felon was not successfully recaptured.
<br><br>
As work on the asylum neared completion, Arkham moved his family back to Gotham, unaware that he was being stalked by Hawkins. He arrived home in April 1921 to discover Hawkins had raped and murdered both Constance and Harriet, even leaving his nickname carved on Harriet's fresh corpse. Although seemingly detached from their deaths Amadeus was in fact permanently unhinged by the incident, which further ushered his descent into madness. Hawkins was tracked down by the Gotham City Police Department (GCPD), and when Arkham Asylum opened its doors in November 1921 he was committed as its first inmate. Arkham personally treated "Mad Dog" for several months without incident, but on the anniversary of his family's murder he suffered a psychotic break and executed Hawkins during a faux electroshock therapy session. The GCPD ruled it an accident. Arkham's mental state continued to deteriorate until 1929, when he was convicted of killing his stockbroker, and became a ward of his own hospital.
<br><br>
Since the 1920s, Arkham Asylum has been destroyed, usually violently, on multiple occasions and rebuilt or expanded; for those patients with unique security or health considerations, customized facilities have been installed at considerable expense, such as a refrigerated cell for Mr. Freeze. The asylum has continued to grow larger and more modern in appearance, although as the lion's share of the budget is devoted to security treatment options have inevitably suffered. Despite the installation of advanced technological security measures in the era of metahuman criminals, the inmates have still been able to escape or take control of the facilities from time to time.</p>

<h2 id='ACity'>Arkham City</h2>
<p>Arkham City first receives mention in Batman: Arkham Asylum in a hidden Easter egg. In fact, the secret was so well hidden that it was not known about until the developers at Rocksteady revealed it just after showing the initial teasers for Batman: Arkham City. The plans for Arkham City can be found in a hidden room inside Warden Sharp's office. After entering the office, bomb the far left wall 3 times with explosive gel to reveal a hidden room which is not visible in detective mode. Inside is Sharp's private office with plans on the wall detailing the proposed Arkham City. Additionally, the blueprints for the site have the stamp of approval from city hall which indicates that Sharp had been planning the creation of this area for sometime prior to the events of the first game.
<br><br>
After the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum, Quincy Sharp, the former warden, wins his mayoral campaign when he takes complete credit for stopping the Joker. After winning in a landslide victory, Sharp implements plans to build a new prison after the fire at Blackgate and the havoc caused at Arkham. The result is Arkham City, a portion of the Gotham slums that is walled off and where prisoners from both the asylum and Blackgate can be housed. The location is not the typical prison in that there are no cells and the inmates are allowed to freely roam the environment. In fact, the only rule is to not attempt to escape as the penalty is death. Helicopters and SWAT officers patrol the borders to maintain the lock down on the area. Of course the freedom enjoyed by the prisoners inside leads to complete and total anarchy within the walls of the prison. Given some of the information found about Sharp in B:AA it stands to reason that this is intentional as Sharp seems to want the prisoners within to wipe each other out.
<br><br>
Rocksteady has commented that the outdoor areas of Arkham City will comprise approximately 80% of the gameplay environments for Batman: Arkham City with the remaining 20% being indoor environments. Given the size of Arkham City, the game is taking on a more open world style of gameplay. As a result traversal will be accomplished by gliding and grappling across. Moreover, the glide physics for Batman have been changed in the next game so that a player can continually glide over long distances in a fashion similar to Just Cause 2. Players can also grapple onto passing Helicopters.

<h2 id="BCave">Batcave</h2>
<p>A series of cave systems was discovered by Bruce Wayne during his early forays into crime fighting. Originally used by his ancestors during the Civil War to transport and harbor slaves along the Underground Railroad, Wayne found the location ideal for storing his crime fighting equipment. It is usually depicted as the home of numerous real bats.
 <br><br>
The cave is commonly depicted as having two entrances: one is located within Wayne Manor, usually behind a grandfather clock or a hidden bookshelf. The second leads directly to the wilderness surrounding the manor and is concealed either by a naturally-occurring waterfall or a force field camouflage system.
 <br><br>
Batman stores numerous supplies within the Batcave, including alternate Batsuits, the Batmobile, the Batwing, and his extensive array of different vehicles and crime fighting tools. Wayne also has a penchant for collecting trophies from the super villains he defeats, such as a giant penny representing Two-Face and a full-size Tyrannosaurus Rex. The cave also contains a tribute to fallen Robin; Jason Todd.
 <br><br>
The heart of the Batcave is The Dark Knight's sophisticated computer command center, providing access to his extensive criminal database. From his terminal, Batman can monitor the entirety of Gotham City, as well as run sophisticated scientific experiments. The system is capable of generating three dimensional projections of data and has been rumored to be near the power of the theorized quantum computer.

 <br><br>
As time passed, Batman upgraded the underground tunnel and placed a secret elevator which connected the secret laboratory to the underground tunnel. He designed the place as an underground hangar to hide all his vehicles and also included a place to repair and do mechanical work. The old disguised barn was left empty and only used to conceal the Bat-vehicles that emerged from the underground. The ground between Wayne Manor and the barn was filled with reinforced concrete to secure the main structure
 <br><br>
Not long after this, Batman created a "costume room", in which he would store all his Batsuits, removing them from Wayne Manor.[14] Batman also installed a sliding-wall to prevent any intruders from entering the Batcave by mistake or on purpose.[15] The next security upgrade included a series of laser beams on every entrance of the cave that once activated, would trigger an alarm in case any object touched the lasers.[16] Batman also installed emergency walls made of steel to contain sudden flows of water into the cave, as it was always in constant risk of flooding.[17] In order to know whenever the Bat-Signal was activated while Batman and Robin were in the cave, Batman installed and electric transmitter that was activated when the Bat-Signal was turned on and as a result, a red bulb would flash in the transmitter's panel on the cave, informing Batman that he's being summoned at the GCPD
<br><br>
The cave was also connected to the cellar of an abandoned shack on the outskirts of Gotham. The laboratory was located in main area of the cave, which was also the parking place of the Batmobile. The cave was supported by a metallic structure and it provided a large space for training.
